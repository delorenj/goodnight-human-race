# Product Requirements Document: Goodnight, Human Race v2.0

## Executive Summary

Enhance the existing "Goodnight, Human Race" application to allow customizable story themes, add irreverent humor, implement story persistence with Google Cloud services, and enable personal API key management.

## Project Overview

### Current State

- Single-page web app that explains complex topics through tiny cat metaphors
- Uses Google's Gemini AI for story and illustration generation
- Fixed theme (tiny cats) with predefined examples

### Future State

- Customizable story themes (e.g., "Cute monsters", "A naughty sledgehammer named Tonny")
- Irreverent humor that playfully contrasts children's book simplicity with serious topics
- Story persistence and retrieval via Google Cloud services
- Personal API key management for broader accessibility
- simple child-like music and sound effects to enhance user experience
- Slides will have either the default music or a "mood" track based on the context of the current slide. For example, a slide about a black hole might switch to a dramatic, suspenseful track on the slide where a cat is falling into a black hole. On a slide where a cat is rescued, it might switch to a happy, uplifting track.

## Core Features

### 1. Dynamic Theme System

**User Story**: As a user, I want to specify both a topic AND a theme for my story so I can enjoy different narrative styles.

**Requirements**:

- Add a second input field for "Story Theme" (placeholder: "e.g., Cute monsters, A naughty sledgehammer named Tonny")
- Default theme: "Tiny cats" (for backwards compatibility)
- Theme should influence both narrative style and illustration prompts
- Theme examples button showing creative possibilities

### 2. Irreverent Humor Integration

**User Story**: As a user, I want stories that subtly poke fun at the children's book format while explaining serious topics.

**Requirements**:

- Modify AI prompts to inject self-aware, irreverent humor
- Maintain innocent surface-level narrative while adding layers of adult humor
- Balance between educational content and entertainment
- Examples of humor style:
  - "The quantum particles danced with glee like they were at the Particle Junior Prom while their particle dates we standing alone drinking punch with the teachers."
  - "And like the big chungus it is, the black hole swallowed everything up in its path."

### 3. Story Persistence & History

**User Story**: As a user, I want to save and revisit my generated stories.

**Google Cloud Implementation**:

- **Firestore**: NoSQL database for story metadata and content
- **Cloud Storage**: Store generated images as files
- **Firebase Authentication**: Simple anonymous auth for story ownership

**Data Model**:

```typescript
interface Story {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  title: string;
  topic: string;
  theme: string;
  content: StorySlide[];
  createdAt: timestamp;
  thumbnailUrl?: string;
}

interface User {
  id: string;
  apiKey?: string; // optional user-provided API key
  createdAt: timestamp;
}

interface Settings {
  apiKey?: string; // user-provided API key
  useIdeogram: boolean; // Optional setting for using ideogram images
  soundEnabled: boolean;
}

interface StorySlide {
  text: string;
  imageUrl: string;
  bgmUrl?: string;
  sfxUrl?: string;
  sfxDelay?: number; // delay in seconds before sound effect plays
  slideNumber: number;
  totalSlides: number;
  isLastSlide: boolean; // indicates if this is the last slide in the story
  isFirstSlide: boolean; // indicates if this is the first slide in the story
  isLoading: boolean; // indicates if the slide is currently loading
}
```

**UI Requirements**:

- Collapsible sidebar (left) showing story history
- Story entries display: title, theme icon
- Click to load previous story
- Delete option for each story
- Search/filter functionality (future enhancement)

### 4. Personal API Key Management

**User Story**: As a user, I want to use my own Gemini API key so I can use the app without restrictions.

**Requirements**:

- Settings modal/panel accessible via gear icon
- Secure client-side storage (localStorage with encryption)
- API key validation before saving
- Clear instructions with link to Google AI Studio
- Fallback to app's default key (if available) with usage limits
- Visual indicator showing which key is active

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Enhancements

- **State Management**: Migrate from simple state object to Zustand
- **Routing**: Add simple client-side routing for story permalinks
- **Components**: Refactor monolithic index.tsx into modular components:
  - StoryGenerator
  - StorySidebar
  - StoryViewer
  - SettingsModal
  - ThemeSelector

### Google Cloud Services Stack

1. **Firebase (for simplicity and integration)**:

   - Firestore for story data
   - Firebase Storage for images
   - Firebase Auth (anonymous users)
   - Firebase Hosting (optional, for deployment)

2. **Setup Requirements**:
   - Firebase project initialization
   - Firestore security rules (users can only access their own stories)
   - Storage bucket configuration
   - Environment variables for Firebase config

### API Design

```typescript
// Story Operations
createStory(topic: string, theme: string): Promise<Story>
getMyStories(): Promise<Story[]>
getStory(storyId: string): Promise<Story>
deleteStory(storyId: string): Promise<void>

// User Operations
initializeUser(): Promise<User>
saveApiKey(encryptedKey: string): Promise<void>
```
